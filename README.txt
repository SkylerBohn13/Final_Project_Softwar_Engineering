## Project Name: Simulating a Voting System in the United States


## Introduction
This Project aims to simulate the voting system in the United States, particularly at the federal level - for President, VP, Senator, and House Representative. The User Interface contains the 'Admin Tool' and the 'Voter Tool'.

- The Admin Tool entails all processes of Voter and Candidate Registration.
- For both registrations, each Voter and Candidate inputs/registers his/her personal information through the User Interface.
- Voter Registration is accomplished by generating a unique Voter ID through each voter's first name, last name, and address. The ID is then added to an initially empty voter database and then cross-checked with that database to ensure that no two Voter ID's match.
- Candidate Registration is accomplished by collecting each Candidate's Information from their candidate-inputed firstname, lastname, and contested political position. The Candidate Information is then added to a separate candidate database.

- The Voter Tool then gives registered voters an opportunity to vote for their preferred candidate for each category through the User Interface.
- After all votes are collated, the winner of each category is declared to the public.

## Requirements
Asides the IDE's for the relevant languages, no additional modules or libraries are required to have the working code.


## Installation
This code requires the following installation:
- Pip install pipenv
- Pipenv install
Then set the flask_app = app.py


## Configuration
Since there are no additional modules to be installed, there is little to no configuration needed.
